## About This Guide

**Current situation:** 5 years old, recognises letters but cannot yet read independently.

**Goal:** Build a strong academic foundation to:
1. Enter an **Opportunity Class (OC)** in Year 5 (test taken in Year 4, age ~9)
2. Enter a **Selective High School** in Year 7 (test taken in Year 6, age ~11)
3. Develop a lifelong love of learning in **STEM, medicine, or technology**

**Philosophy:** This guide follows proven educational research — nurturing intrinsic motivation, building strong foundations before speed, and making learning enjoyable. No child should be burned out before they reach high school.

## Understanding the NSW Pathway

### Timeline Overview

```
Age 5 (Kindy)     → Learn to read, number sense, curiosity
Age 6 (Year 1)    → Fluent reading, basic maths, reasoning
Age 7 (Year 2)    → Chapter books, times tables, problem solving
Age 8 (Year 3)    → NAPLAN Year 3, advanced reading, OC prep begins
Age 9 (Year 4)    → ★ OC PLACEMENT TEST (May) — entry to Year 5 OC
Age 10 (Year 5)   → OC Class begins, deepen all skills
Age 11 (Year 6)   → ★ SELECTIVE HIGH SCHOOL TEST (May) — entry to Year 7
Age 12 (Year 7)   → Selective High School begins
```

### What is Tested?

#### OC Placement Test (Year 4 → Year 5 entry)
| Component | Questions | Duration |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Thinking Skills | 35 questions | 30 minutes |
| Mathematical Reasoning | 35 questions | 40 minutes |
| Reading | 30 questions | 30 minutes |

#### Selective High School Placement Test (Year 6 → Year 7 entry)
| Component | Questions | Duration |

- **Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach** to mathematics (Singapore Math methodology)
- **Spaced repetition** for retention of facts and skills
- **Growth mindset** principles (Carol Dweck's research)
- **Zone of Proximal Development** (Vygotsky) — always working just above current ability
- **Deliberate practice** (Anders Ericsson) — focused, effortful practice with feedback

**See:** [resources/research-evidence.md](resources/research-evidence.md)

## Daily Schedule Template

### Weekday (School Days) — 30-45 min total
| Time | Activity | Duration |
|------|----------|----------|
| After school | Reading (independent + read-aloud) | 15-20 min |
| After school | Maths practice (workbook or app) | 10-15 min |
| Before bed | Read-aloud with parent | 10-15 min |

### Weekend — 60-90 min total (spread across the day)
| Time | Activity | Duration |
|------|----------|----------|
