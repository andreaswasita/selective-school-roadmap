## 🏫 NAPLAN Year 3

### What is NAPLAN?

National Assessment Program — Literacy and Numeracy. Every Year 3 student in Australia sits this test (online) in March. It tests:

| Domain | Format |
|--------|--------|
| Reading | Multiple choice & short answer |
| Writing | Extended response to a prompt |
| Language Conventions | Spelling, grammar, punctuation |
| Numeracy | Multiple choice & short answer |

### How NAPLAN Relates to OC/Selective Prep

NAPLAN is a **benchmark**, not the goal. But performing well in NAPLAN shows that foundational skills are strong. The skills tested overlap with OC test requirements:

| NAPLAN Skill | OC Test Equivalent |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Reading comprehension | Reading section |
| Numeracy | Mathematical Reasoning |
| Language conventions | Supports reading & writing |
| Writing | Not in OC test (but in Selective test) |

### NAPLAN Preparation

| Resource | Type | Cost |
|----------|------|------|
| **Official NAPLAN practice tests** | Online | FREE (via school) |
| **Excel NAPLAN-style Tests Year 3** | Workbook | ~$20 |
| **Blake's NAPLAN Year 3** | Workbook | ~$15 |
| **NAPLAN*Style Year 3 (Lioncrest)** | Workbook | ~$18 |

## 🎯 OC Test Preparation Strategy

### Understanding the OC Test

The OC Placement Test has three components:

| Component | Questions | Time | What's Tested |
|-----------|-----------|------|---------------|
| **Thinking Skills** | 35 | 30 min | Patterns, sequences, spatial reasoning, logical deduction |
| **Mathematical Reasoning** | 35 | 40 min | Problem solving, not just computation |
| **Reading** | 30 | 30 min | Deep comprehension, inference, vocabulary in context |

### The "Coach-Proof" Reality

Since the 2021 reforms, the NSW Department of Education redesigned the tests to reduce the advantage of tutoring/coaching. The questions:
- Test **genuine understanding**, not memorised procedures
- Include novel problem types that can't be drilled
- Require **thinking on the spot**, not pattern recognition of familiar question types

### What This Means for Preparation

**Don't:** Cram 1,000 practice papers from a tutoring centre.  
**Do:** Build genuine capability across all three domains through deep learning + targeted practice.

### Preparation Balance

```
70% — Building genuine skills (reading widely, mathematical thinking, puzzles)
20% — Familiarisation with test format (practice papers)
10% — Test-taking skills (time management, process of elimination)
```

## 📖 Reading at Year 3 Level

### Advanced Reading Materials

| Book/Series | Level | Why |
|-------------|-------|-----|
| **Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone** | Year 3-4 | If ready — a massive confidence boost |
| **Percy Jackson** series | Year 3-5 | Mythology + adventure, very engaging |
| **The BFG** (Roald Dahl) | Year 3-4 | Rich vocabulary, creative language |
| **Charlie and the Chocolate Factory** | Year 3 | Classic, wonderful language |
| **Treehouse series (78+)** | Year 3-4 | Australian, can't stop reading |
| **Wings of Fire** | Year 3-5 | Popular series, builds stamina |
| **Hatchet** (Gary Paulsen) | Year 3-4 | Survival story, great for boys |
| **Wonder** (R.J. Palacio) | Year 4-5 | Empathy, deeper themes |
| **Artemis Fowl** | Year 4-5 | Clever, tech-oriented, challenging |

### Building Deep Comprehension

Move beyond "what happened" to:

| Level | Question Type | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Literal** | What happened? | "Where did the character go?" |
| **Inferential** | Why/How? | "Why do you think the character felt upset?" |
| **Evaluative** | Judge/Assess | "Was the character's decision a good one? Why?" |
| **Critical** | Analyse author's craft | "Why did the author choose that word?" |

> **Inferential comprehension is the most tested skill in the OC and Selective tests.** Practice it daily during read-aloud.

## 🔢 Mathematics — Problem-Solving Focus

### Times Tables: Must Be Automatic

If not yet mastered by start of Year 3, this is **priority #1**. Every times table fact should be recalled in under 3 seconds.

**Diagnostic:** Time him on a 50-fact mixed times tables quiz. Target: under 3 minutes.

### Mathematical Reasoning Development

The OC test doesn't ask "What is 7 × 8?" It asks problems like:
- "A farmer has 3 paddocks with 8 sheep each, and 2 paddocks with 6 cows each. How many more sheep than cows does the farmer have?"
- "What fraction of this shape is shaded?"
- "If the pattern continues, what will the 10th number be?"

### Practice Resources

| Resource | Type | Focus | Cost |
|----------|------|-------|------|
| **Primary Mathematics Challenging Word Problems Yr 3** | Workbook | Problem solving (Singapore) | ~$15 |
| **Excel Test Zone OC & Selective Tests — Mathematics** | Workbook | OC-style questions | ~$20 |
| **Mathematical Olympiad problems (Year 3-4)** | Printable | Extension | Various |
| **ICAS Maths papers (Year 3)** | Past papers | Competition-level | ~$15 |
| **Khan Academy Year 3-4** | Online | All topics | FREE |

- Codes and ciphers (A=1, B=2, etc.)

#### Logical Deduction
- "If all dogs are animals, and Rex is a dog, then..."
- Venn diagrams

## ✍️ Writing Development

### NAPLAN Writing Preparation

Year 3 NAPLAN includes an extended writing task. Teach both text types:

#### Narrative Writing Structure
```
Orientation  → Who? Where? When?
Complication → What problem occurs?
Rising Action → How does it get worse?
Climax       → The turning point
Resolution   → How is it solved?
```

#### Persuasive Writing Structure
```
Introduction → State your position clearly
Argument 1   → Strongest reason + evidence
Argument 2   → Second reason + evidence  
Argument 3   → Third reason + evidence
Conclusion   → Restate position, call to action
```

### Writing Practice Schedule

| Day | Activity | Duration |
|-----|----------|----------|
| Mon | Narrative writing (creative story) | 15 min |
| Wed | Persuasive writing (opinion piece) | 15 min |
| Fri | Free writing or book review | 15 min |
| Daily | Reading journal (3-4 sentences about what was read) | 5 min |

## 🧪 Test-Taking Skills to Develop

Start teaching these explicitly — they make a significant difference:

1. **Read every question carefully** — underline key words
2. **Process of elimination** — cross out obviously wrong answers
3. **Time awareness** — roughly 1 minute per question
4. **Skip and return** — don't get stuck on hard questions
5. **Check work** — if time remains, review flagged questions
6. **Stay calm** — deep breaths, it's just a test
7. **No blank answers** — always make a best guess

## ❓ To Tutor or Not to Tutor?

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **No tutoring** | Cheaper, no burnout risk, develops independence | May miss specific test strategies |
| **Group tutoring (e.g., James An, North Shore)** | Structured, social, test practice | Expensive ($200-400/month), can teach test-taking tricks not genuine thinking |
| **Private tutor** | Personalised, addresses specific weaknesses | Most expensive ($60-100/hour) |
| **Parent-guided (this roadmap)** | Free, bonding, you know your child best | Requires your time and discipline |

### Recommendation

For a **driven child** with a **committed parent**, parent-guided preparation using quality resources is highly effective and avoids the downsides of commercial tutoring factories. If you want external help, consider:
- A private tutor for **specific weak areas only** (e.g., 1 hour/week for thinking skills)
- Online programs like **IXL or Mathletics** for structured practice
- **ICAS competitions** for test experience
