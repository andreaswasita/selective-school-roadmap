## ✍️ Writing Component

### This is NEW compared to the OC test

The Selective test includes a 30-minute writing task. Students respond to a prompt (stimulus) and may write either a **narrative** or **persuasive** piece.

### Narrative Writing Framework

```
OPENING (Hook the reader)
  → Engaging first sentence
  → Establish character, setting, mood

COMPLICATION (Build tension)
  → Problem or conflict introduced
  → Rising action — things get worse

CLIMAX (Turning point)
  → Most intense moment
  → Character makes a key decision

RESOLUTION (Wrap up)
  → Problem resolved
  → Character has changed/learned something

CODA (Final punch)
  → Reflection or twist
  → Memorable final line
```

### Persuasive Writing Framework (PEEL × 3)

```
INTRODUCTION
  → Hook, context, state your position (thesis)

BODY PARAGRAPH 1 (Strongest argument)
  → Point: State your argument
  → Evidence: Facts, statistics, examples
  → Explain: Why this evidence supports your point
  → Link: Connect back to your thesis

BODY PARAGRAPH 2 (Second argument)
  → Same PEEL structure

BODY PARAGRAPH 3 (Third argument or counter-argument)
  → Address the opposing view, then refute it

CONCLUSION
  → Restate position
  → Summarise key arguments
  → Call to action or thought-provoking final statement
```

### Writing Practice

| Activity | Frequency | Details |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Timed writing (25 min) | 2x/week | Alternate narrative and persuasive |
| Self-editing | After each piece | Use ARMS checklist: Add, Remove, Move, Substitute |
