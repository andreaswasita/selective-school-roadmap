## 📖 Reading Deep Dive

### This is the Year Reading "Clicks"

By Year 2, a child should transition from **learning to read** → **reading to learn**. This is transformational. Once he can read fluently, he can teach himself almost anything.

### Building Comprehension Skills

Teach these 7 comprehension strategies explicitly:

| Strategy | How to Teach |
|----------|-------------|
| **Predicting** | "What do you think will happen next? Why?" |
| **Questioning** | "What questions do you have about this chapter?" |
| **Clarifying** | "Is there a word you don't understand? Let's look it up." |
| **Summarising** | "Tell me what happened in 2-3 sentences." |
| **Connecting** | "Does this remind you of anything in your life?" |
| **Visualising** | "What did you picture in your mind when you read that?" |
| **Inferring** | "The text doesn't say it directly, but what do you think the character is feeling?" |

### Book Recommendations — Year 2

## 🔢 Mathematics — Times Tables Focus

### Why Times Tables Matter So Much

Times tables are the **foundation for everything** that comes next: division, fractions, algebra, and the selective test. Children who have automatic times table recall perform significantly better in maths.

### Attack Plan

| Term | Tables to Master | Method |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| Term 1 | 2x, 10x | Skip counting songs, patterns |
| Term 2 | 5x, 4x | Building on 2x (double the doubles) |
| Term 3 | 3x, 6x | Songs, rapid recall drills |
| Term 4 | 7x, 8x, 9x | 9x finger trick, practice |

### Proven Methods for Times Tables

1. **Songs & Chants** — Multiplication rap songs (YouTube: "Times Tables Rock Stars")
2. **Skip counting** — Count by 3s, 4s, etc. while bouncing a ball
3. **Visual arrays** — Draw dots in rows to show 3 × 4 = 12
4. **Speed drills** — Timed worksheets (2 minutes, get faster each week)
5. **Games** — Card games, dice games, apps
6. **Real life** — "How many wheels on 4 cars?" (4 × 4)

### Times Table Apps & Tools

| Tool | Type | Cost |
|------|------|------|
| **Times Tables Rock Stars (TTRS)** | Web/App | ~$25/yr |
| **Squeebles Times Tables** | App | ~$5 one-off |

## 🧠 Thinking Skills — Getting Serious

### Why Start Now?

OC test is in ~2 years. Thinking skills (pattern recognition, spatial reasoning, logical deduction) are **trainable** but take time to develop. Start building the neural pathways now.

### Types of Thinking Skills Questions

| Type | Example | Skill |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Number patterns** | 2, 4, 6, ?, 10 | Pattern recognition |
| **Shape patterns** | △□△□? | Visual pattern recognition |
| **Analogies** | Hot is to cold as big is to ___? | Verbal reasoning |
| **Spatial rotation** | Which shape is this rotated 90°? | Spatial awareness |
| **Matrix patterns** | 3×3 grid with missing piece | Abstract reasoning |
| **Sequences** | What comes next in the sequence? | Logical thinking |
| **Odd one out** | Which one doesn't belong? | Classification |

### Practice Resources

| Resource | Type | Cost |
|----------|------|------|
| **Building Thinking Skills Level 1** (Critical Thinking Co.) | Workbook | ~$30 |
| **Primary Mathematics Challenging Word Problems** | Workbook | ~$15 |
| **ICAS practice papers (Year 2)** | Past papers | ~$15 |

## ✍️ Writing Development

### Structure to Teach

**Paragraph writing formula (TEEL for kids):**
1. **Topic sentence** — What is this paragraph about?
2. **Explain/Example** — Give details or examples
3. **Elaborate** — Say more about it
4. **Link/Ending** — Wrap up the paragraph

### Writing Activities

| Activity | Frequency | Benefits |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Daily journal** (3-5 sentences) | Daily | Fluency, habit |
| **Book report** (1 paragraph) | Weekly | Comprehension + writing |
| **Story writing** (beginning-middle-end) | Weekly | Narrative structure |
| **Letter/email to a relative** | Monthly | Purpose, audience awareness |
| **Fact report** on an animal/topic | Monthly | Non-fiction writing |

## 💡 Key Year 2 Insights

### Competitions to Consider
| Competition | When | What | Cost |
|------------|------|------|------|
| **ICAS Mathematics** | May-Jun | International maths competition | ~$15 |
| **ICAS English** | May-Jun | International English competition | ~$15 |
| **Australian Maths Competition (AMC)** | August | National maths (Year 3+) | ~$7 |

> **Note:** Don't enter competitions to win — enter them for the **experience** of sitting a timed test in a formal setting. This desensitises test anxiety before the OC test.

### Extra-Curricular Activities
- **Chess club** — Many schools offer this; if not, local clubs or online (Chess.com/kids)
- **Swimming** — Teaches discipline, goal-setting, physicality
- **Music** — Piano or an instrument — research links music training to improved mathematical and spatial reasoning
- **Coding club** — Libraries and community centres often run free Scratch workshops
