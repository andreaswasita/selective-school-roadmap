# 🧠 Thinking Skills (General Ability) Guide

> The most "trainable" component of the OC and Selective tests. Consistent practice over years builds genuine thinking ability.

## What Are Thinking Skills?

Thinking Skills (called "General Ability" in older test versions) assess:
- **Pattern recognition** — Identifying rules and relationships
- **Spatial reasoning** — Mentally manipulating shapes and objects
- **Logical deduction** — Drawing conclusions from given information
- **Abstract reasoning** — Working with novel, unfamiliar problems
- **Verbal reasoning** — Understanding relationships between words/concepts

These are NOT knowledge-based. They test **how you think**, not what you know.

## Question Types Explained

### 1. Pattern Matrices (Most Common — ~30% of test)

A grid (usually 3×3) with shapes/symbols. One cell is missing. Find the pattern across rows AND columns.

**How to solve:**
1. Look across each **row** — what changes?
2. Look down each **column** — what changes?
3. The answer must satisfy BOTH row and column patterns
4. Check: size? colour? shape? number? rotation? position?

**Practice progression:**
- Start with 2×2 matrices (age 6-7)
- Move to 3×3 with 1 variable changing (age 7-8)
- Advance to 3×3 with 2+ variables (age 8-9)
- Master 3×3 with complex, interacting variables (age 9+)

### 2. Spatial Reasoning (~25% of test)

#### Paper Folding
A piece of paper is folded and a hole is punched. When unfolded, where are the holes?

**How to practise:** Use actual paper! Fold it, punch holes, predict the result, then unfold to check.

#### Mirror Images / Reflections
What does this shape look like when reflected in a mirror line?

**How to practise:**
- Use a physical mirror with printed shapes
- Draw mirror images on grid paper
- Practice with letters (b ↔ d, p ↔ q)

#### Rotations
What does this shape look like when rotated 90°, 180°, 270°?

**How to practise:**
- Use tracing paper — trace the shape, then physically rotate it
- Start with simple shapes, progress to complex ones
- Clock direction awareness: clockwise vs anticlockwise

#### 3D Visualization
- Which net folds into this cube?
- How many blocks in this 3D figure?
- What does this 3D shape look like from the top/side/front?

**How to practise:**
- Build with blocks, then draw different views
- Cut out nets and fold them
- Use apps like "GeoGebra 3D"

### 3. Number Sequences (~15% of test)

#### Types
| Type | Example | Rule |
|------|---------|------|
| Arithmetic | 3, 7, 11, 15, ___ | +4 each time |
| Geometric | 2, 6, 18, 54, ___ | ×3 each time |
| Two-operation | 1, 3, 7, 15, ___ | ×2 + 1 each time |
| Alternating | 2, 5, 3, 6, 4, ___ | Two interleaved sequences |
| Fibonacci-type | 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ___ | Add previous two numbers |
| Difference pattern | 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, ___ | Differences increase: +1, +2, +3, +4 |

**Strategy:** Always look at the DIFFERENCES between consecutive numbers first.

---

### 4. Verbal/Abstract Analogies (~15% of test)

#### Word Analogies
"Hot is to cold as tall is to ___"
Pattern: opposites → answer must be an opposite of "tall" → short

Common relationships:
| Relationship | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| Opposites | Hot : cold = light : dark |
| Part : whole | Wheel : car = page : book |
| Tool : function | Pen : write = hammer : hit |
| Category : member | Fruit : apple = colour : blue |
| Synonym | Big : large = small : tiny |
| Degree | Warm : hot = cool : cold |

#### Picture Analogies
Same as word analogies but with shapes/images.

---

### 5. Logical Deduction (~15% of test)

#### Syllogisms
"All dogs are animals. Rex is a dog. Therefore, Rex is ___."

#### Ordering Problems
"Amy is taller than Bob. Bob is taller than Carl. Who is tallest?"

**How to practise:** Draw diagrams! Use lines, arrows, or tables to organise information.

#### Venn Diagrams
Given overlapping sets, work out quantities in each region.

#### Code-breaking
If CAT = 3-1-20, what does DOG = ?

## Tips for Improvement

1. **Don't just do questions — review WHY you got it wrong**
2. **Talk through your thinking** — verbalising logic improves it
3. **Draw diagrams** — visual thinkers perform better on spatial questions
4. **Time awareness** — practise under gentle time pressure
5. **Variety matters** — don't just drill one type; mix them all
6. **Games are practice too** — chess, SET, Blokus, Rubik's cube
7. **Sleep is critical** — the brain consolidates thinking patterns during sleep
8. **Physical exercise** helps thinking — blood flow to the brain matters
