## Age 5-6: Building Blocks

### First Writing Steps
- **Draw and label** — Draw a picture, write the word underneath
- **Sentence starters** — "I like...", "I can see...", "My favourite..."
- **Invented spelling is OK** — "I lyk mi dog" is great progress! Don't over-correct
- **Model writing** — Child watches you write, then copies/attempts

### Key Conventions
- Capital letter at the start
- Full stop at the end
- Finger spaces between words
- Letters sitting on the line

## Age 7-8: Paragraph Writing

### Paragraph Structure (Simple)
1. **Topic sentence** — What is this paragraph about?
2. **Detail sentences** — 3-4 sentences with examples/information
3. **Closing sentence** — Wrap up the paragraph

### Narrative Writing (Beginning-Middle-End)
```
BEGINNING: Who is the character? Where are they? When?
MIDDLE:    What problem happens? What do they do?
END:       How is the problem solved? How does the character feel?
```

### Writing Activities

|----------|-----------|---------|
| Daily journal | Daily (5 min) | Fluency, habit |
| Story writing | 2x/week | Narrative skills |
| Book review | Weekly | Opinion + evidence |
| Letter to someone | Monthly | Audience awareness |
| Fact report | Monthly | Informational writing |

## Age 8-9: Genre Mastery

### Narrative Writing (Full Structure)

```
ORIENTATION       → Who? Where? When? (Set the scene)
  - Describe the character and setting vividly
  - Create atmosphere/mood
  
COMPLICATION      → What goes wrong?
  - Introduce the problem/conflict
  - Show, don't tell (emotions through actions)
  
RISING ACTION     → How does it get worse?
  - Build tension
  - Add obstacles and challenges
  
CLIMAX           → The most intense moment
  - Turning point of the story

FALLING ACTION    → Consequences of the climax
  
RESOLUTION       → How is it resolved?

```

### Persuasive Writing (PEEL structure)

```
