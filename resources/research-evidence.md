## 1. The Science of Reading

### What the Research Says
Decades of research (the "Reading Wars" are settled) conclusively shows that **systematic synthetic phonics** is the most effective method for teaching children to read.

### Key Studies & Reports
- **National Reading Panel (2000)** — US report reviewing 100,000+ studies. Concluded systematic phonics instruction is significantly more effective than non-phonics approaches.
- **Rose Report (2006, UK)** — Found synthetic phonics should be the prime approach to teaching reading. Led to UK curriculum changes.
- **Castles, Rastle & Nation (2018)** — "Ending the Reading Wars: Reading Acquisition from Novice to Expert" — Comprehensive review confirming phonics as essential foundation.
- **NSW Curriculum Review (2020)** — NSW adopted phonics-based approaches in the national curriculum.

### The Simple View of Reading
```
Reading Comprehension = Decoding × Language Comprehension
```
Both components are necessary. Phonics builds decoding; read-alouds and conversation build language comprehension.

### Application in This Roadmap
- Phase 1 focuses heavily on systematic phonics
- Decodable readers are used before levelled readers
- Read-alouds build the language comprehension side simultaneously

## 2. Singapore Math / Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA)

### What the Research Says
The CPA approach, developed by Jerome Bruner and extensively used in Singapore's mathematics curriculum, leads to deeper understanding than abstract-only teaching.

### Evidence
- **TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study)** — Singapore has ranked #1 or #2 globally in mathematics consistently since 1995.
- **Bruner, J. (1966)** — *Toward a Theory of Instruction* — Established that learning progresses through enactive (concrete), iconic (pictorial), and symbolic (abstract) stages.
- **Leong et al. (2015)** — Research showing CPA approach leads to significantly better problem-solving performance.

### Application in This Roadmap
- Manipulatives (blocks, rods, counters) recommended for all early maths
- Bar model method taught from Year 2
- Abstract notation introduced only after concrete and pictorial understanding

## 3. Growth Mindset

### What the Research Says
Carol Dweck's research at Stanford shows that children who believe intelligence is developable (growth mindset) outperform those who believe it's fixed.

### Key Findings
- **Dweck, C. (2006)** — *Mindset: The New Psychology of Success*
- Students praised for effort ("You worked hard!") perform better long-term than students praised for intelligence ("You're so smart!")
- Growth mindset is especially important for challenging subjects like mathematics

### Application in This Roadmap
- Emphasis on praising effort and process, not innate ability
- Mistakes framed as learning opportunities
- Difficulty is reframed as "your brain is growing"
- "Not yet" language: "You haven't mastered this yet"

---

## 4. Spaced Repetition

### What the Research Says
The spacing effect (Ebbinghaus, 1885) shows that information is better retained when review sessions are spaced out over time, rather than crammed.

### Evidence
- **Ebbinghaus, H. (1885)** — *Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology*
- **Cepeda et al. (2006)** — Meta-analysis of 254 studies confirming the spacing effect
- **Pashler et al. (2007)** — Optimal spacing intervals for long-term retention

### Application in This Roadmap
- Daily short practice sessions (15-20 min) rather than weekly cramming
- Times tables reviewed daily until automatic
- Skills revisited across weeks and months
- Consistent routine across the school year

## 5. Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)

### What the Research Says
Vygotsky's ZPD theory states that optimal learning occurs in the zone between what a child can do independently and what they can do with guidance.

### Key Concept
```
Too Easy          → Boredom, no growth
Zone of Proximal  → Productive struggle with support (OPTIMAL)
Development
Too Hard          → Frustration, shutdown
```

### Application in This Roadmap
- Book levels matched to reading ability (not too easy, not too hard)
- Maths problems should be challenging but achievable
- Parent scaffolding: help them think, don't give answers
- Gradually increase difficulty as skills develop

---

## 6. Deliberate Practice

### What the Research Says
Anders Ericsson's research shows that expertise develops through deliberate practice — focused, effortful practice with immediate feedback, targeting specific weaknesses.

### Key Findings
- **Ericsson, K.A. (1993)** — "The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance"
- Not just repetition — deliberate practice involves:
  1. Specific goals for each session
  2. Focused concentration
  3. Immediate feedback
  4. Working at the edge of current ability
  5. Mental representations of what "good" looks like

### Application in This Roadmap
- Practice tests are reviewed, not just scored
- Errors analysed: "Why did I get this wrong? How do I fix it?"
- Focused practice on weak areas, not just repeating strengths
- Short, intense sessions rather than long, unfocused ones

## 7. The Matthew Effect in Reading

### What the Research Says
Keith Stanovich (1986) described how early reading success creates a positive cycle: good readers read more → learn more words → become better readers → read more. The reverse is also true for struggling readers.

### Implication
Starting reading instruction early and effectively is crucial. The gap between good and poor readers **widens** over time if not addressed.

### Application in This Roadmap
- Intensive phonics focus at age 5 to prevent falling behind
- High volume of reading encouraged from the earliest stages
- "Reading for pleasure" is protected time — never punished away

---

## 8. Physical Activity and Cognitive Performance

### What the Research Says
Regular physical activity improves cognitive function, memory, and academic performance in children.

### Evidence
- **Hillman et al. (2008)** — "Be smart, exercise your heart: exercise effects on brain and cognition"
- **Donnelly et al. (2016)** — "Physical Activity, Fitness, Cognitive Function, and Academic Achievement in Children" — meta-analysis
- **Active for Life (Australian Government)** — Recommends 60+ minutes of physical activity daily for children

### Application in This Roadmap
- Sport and outdoor play are recommended alongside academic work
- Study sessions are kept short to prevent burnout
- Physical activity is never sacrificed for extra study time

---

## 9. Sleep and Learning

### What the Research Says
Sleep is critical for memory consolidation and cognitive development in children.

### Evidence
- **Walker, M. (2017)** — *Why We Sleep* — Comprehensive summary of sleep research
- Children aged 5-12 need **9-12 hours of sleep per night** (American Academy of Sleep Medicine)
- Sleep deprivation impairs attention, working memory, and problem-solving

### Application in This Roadmap
- Emphasis on adequate sleep, especially before tests
- Evening routines include reading (calming) not screens
- Study sessions are in the afternoon, not late at night

---

## 10. Intrinsic Motivation

### What the Research Says
Children who are intrinsically motivated (they find learning inherently interesting) outperform those who are externally motivated (rewards/punishment) in the long term.

### Evidence
- **Deci, E.L. & Ryan, R.M. (2000)** — Self-Determination Theory
- Three needs for intrinsic motivation:
  1. **Autonomy** — some choice in what/how they learn
  2. **Competence** — feeling capable and improving
  3. **Relatedness** — connection with supportive people

### Application in This Roadmap
- Child chooses their own books
- Games and fun activities alongside formal practice
- Celebrating progress and effort
- Avoiding excessive pressure or comparing to others
- Learning is framed as interesting and empowering, not a chore
